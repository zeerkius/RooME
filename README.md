# COMP-3322_Project
Software Engineering Group Project

Team Name: Young Innovators

Developers: Synthia , Basil , Kristian


Team Leader: Basil

App Name: RoomME

Project Outline: This will be an application that allows Univeristy Students to pick a roomate.  The app will be made up up of two central components. The anonymous review board as well as the user's personal feed. The kick is that it since it will be based of personal testimony of former and even current roomates. This will allow for a far more accurate description of what you are getting when rooming with said person. 
It will start local to the university (Prairie View A&M Univeirsty).

Project Details: It will begin with ofcourse your user name and password and then information willingly given by the user first starting with "Yes" , or "No" questions. For example do you smoke , and do you bring company often? Then question that prompt longer text like their Major or , their Zodiac sign. Then this will be followed by a rating scale like in which the user can then self rate their Cleanliness and ect.

Novelty: We will then also allow those rating these roomates to rate their scales as of cleanliness and ect based on their testimony. And then we will allow users looking for roomates to see both their self procalimed scales side by side with their scales ranked by 3rd party testimony. Those with a so called Honesty Rating closer to a one(Meaning their ratings of self testimony and 3rd party testimony are the same) Mean that they are more deseriable roomates.
